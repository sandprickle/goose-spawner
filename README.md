# Goose Spawner

This script will *fuck up your computer*. 
Please do not use it. Thanks.


## To use:

* Download Desktop Goose from https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose
* Unzip
* Copy Desktop Goose.app to this directory, and rename to goose.app
* Configure desired number of geese to spawn, and time between spanws, in script. Defualt is 10 geese spawned 5 seconds apart. 
* Make spawn.sh executable with chown u+x spawn.sh
* cleanup.sh removes the goose files.
* Be prepared for things to suck. Especially if you have *attack at random* turned on. You have been warned.

**WARNING**
*You will have to figure out a way to stop the geese yourself.*
*cleanup.sh simply removes the n.goose files. It does not kill the processes. God be with you.*
(I welcome a pull request for this feature. I need to go to bed right now.)
